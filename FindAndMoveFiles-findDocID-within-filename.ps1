.SYNOPSIS
    This script scans a directory for PDF files and checks if their filenames contain any DocIDs listed in a CSV file.
    If a match is found, the script moves the file to a "NewLocation" folder and logs the matched files in a CSV.

.DESCRIPTION
    - Reads a list of DocIDs from "DocIDs.csv".
    - Scans the current directory for PDF files.
    - Checks if any DocID appears anywhere in each filename.
    - Moves matching files to a "NewLocation" folder.
    - Creates a log file ("matched_files.csv") containing the moved filenames.

.PARAMETER
    None (Assumes "DocIDs.csv" exists in the working directory).

.REQUIREMENTS
    - PowerShell 5.0+ recommended.
    - "DocIDs.csv" should be formatted with a single column named "DocID".
    - PDF files should be in the same directory as the script.

.OUTPUTS
    - Matched files are moved to "NewLocation".
    - "matched_files.csv" logs all matched and moved files.

.VERSION
    1.0
